      <h3>What Can I Expect During My First Visit to a Chiropractor?</h3>

      <h4>Consultation</h4>

      <p>
        On your first visit to our office you will be welcomed by our
        receptionist with a warm smile. You will then be asked to fill out our
        required forms which will help us gain some information about yourself
        and your spinal health. Save time by filling out the forms ahead of
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        After reviewing your case history, you and the doctor will discuss your
        condition to determine if chiropractic care may be of benefit to you. If
        we find that your condition would be better served by another physician,
        you will be referred to a doctor that will be able to help you the most.
        However, if our doctor feels he can help you, we will begin our
        examination with your consent. Through out this process, our focus is to
        help you achieve your optimal health potential.
      </p>

      <h4>Examination</h4>

      <p>
        After a thorough consultation with the doctor, you will undergo a
        chiropractic examination. This will include testing your reflexes and
        range of motion as well as other standard orthopedic, neurologic,
        postural, and physical examinations. From this, the doctor will gain
        valuable information regarding your condition and a better understanding
        of how chiropractic can help you. If necessary, the doctor may recommend
        X-rays or refer you for additional testing procedures.
      </p>

      <h4>X-ray</h4>

      <p>
        X-rays are sometimes required to get a full evaluation of a patient's
        condition. The need for X-ray is considered on a case by case basis.
        However, if needed, our office has an on-site, state of the art x-ray
        facility for your convenience.
      </p>

      <h4>Spinal Adjustment</h4>

      <p>
        If both you and the doctor decide that chiropractic care is appropriate,
        spinal adjustments will begin immediately. Other treatment may include
        low level laser, physical therapies , and/or soft tissue therapies. Most
        of our patients begin to see results from the very first spinal
        adjustment. Our special gentle, yet effective, alignment of the body is
        interactive with the patient; gentle enough for kids, yet able to
        restore function and movement for the athlete and senior.
      </p>

      <h4>Home Instructions</h4>

      <p>
        Prior to leaving, patients will be given instructions on certain
        activities or procedures to be conducted at home. This may include ice
        or heat application instructions, avoidance of certain activities or
        positions, as well as home exercises and/or stretches.
      </p>

      <h4>Schedule Your Next Appointment</h4>

      <p>
        You will be given a convenient appointment time for your follow-up
        visit. Generally speaking, patients are seen within 1-2 days and are
        provided with a complete review of findings.
