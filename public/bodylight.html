            Unlike invasive weight loss surger, our procedure is applied
            externally.
          </li>
          <li>
            This revolutionary method provides results without the dangers
            associated with surgery.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlike surgical liposuction, our non-surgical lipo-sculpting allows
            you to remain active-during treatment.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Sessions with our fat loss Slim Co system are easy, painless, and
          carefree. Each session takes less than an hour. The slimming machine
          is used for a total of 15 minutes. The system is applied to the
          targeted area, which is generally the waist, hips, or thighs, for 15
          minutes. The minimum suggested treatment period is two weeks, with
          three full sessions each week. You should consult your technician
          about the maximum results for your body type, weight, and target loss.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many clients have described the session as relaxing, and even Zen.
          Some even try to catch up on phone calls with friends and loved ones
          as they lie down and the system removes excess fat. You simply lie in
          a comfortable, stationary position for twenty minutes at a time, in a
          relaxed environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the fat loss Slim Co system uses cutting edge technology, you
          fell nothing during the procedure. You may feel a bit different and
          lighter as you exit the treatment center due to the bio-stimulation
          that begins in your body to remove excess fat.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are always welcome to listen to music, or just close your eyes and
          rest during the procedure. Listening to white noise such as running
          water or ocean waves is always a relaxing way to spend the sessions.
          Ultimately, the treatment with our fat loss Slim Co system is a stark
          contrast to traditional methods of fat reduction procedures such as
          liposuction and gastric-bypass surgery. With our Slim Co weight loss
          system, you can simply lie down, relax, and let the Slim Co do all the
          work.

                BodyLight lightwave technology stimulates the production of
                collagen and elastin in your skin cells for a pain-free,

                Our facial therapy can help reverse signs of aging by tightening
                skin, reducing the appearance of fine lines and/or wrinkles,
                lightening aging spots and also lightening dark under eye
                circles. Bodylight facial therapy also helps smooth facial
                blemishes and dramatically improves the complexion of skin
                damaged by acne or sun.

              Bodylight sessions have the ability to reduce body mass through
              simple, painless, and noninvasive techniques. We target the areas
              of the body that tend to be difficult to target through diet and
              exercise. With the newest advancements in technology, patients can
              find themselves on the fast track to confidence through a simple
              Bodylight session.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Bodylight emits special frequency light waves that safely
              penetrate the skin and are absorbed by the fat cells. This light
              stimulation opens the pores to the fat cells allowing water,
              glycerol and free fatty acids to move out of the fat cells and
              into the space between the cells. The fat cells then shrink while
              the excess water, glycerol and free fatty acids are safely removed
              by your body's own metabolic process.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              Though the majority of fat can be removed through diet and
              exercise, there are some areas of the body that need a little
              help. Our LED Bodylight is a non-invasive session that can be very
              effective in contouring the body by eliminating fat in those hard
              to lose areas.
            </p>

            <p>
              Patients who are concerned with their body mass index can find a
              helpful solution with our fat reduction system. Without any
              painful incisions or long term programs, the amount of
              subcutaneous fat can be easily reduced, resulting in a leaner body
              shape.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              Results may vary from person to person due to lifestyle, body type
              and dedication to the program. No individual results should be
              seen as typical. Testimonials are stories of individual success
              and should not be taken as a guarantee.

              "I'm a woman in my fifties. I have gone down 3 jean sizes [using
              the Bodylight] and have noticed that my skin looks and feels more
              toned and softer than before. After just 2-3 session I noticed
              these differences and have been most pleased. The bonus is that I
              have more energy and am more conscientious of my diet and exercise
              routine. The Bodylight has been a great motivator for me."
