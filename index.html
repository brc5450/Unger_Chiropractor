      <h3>Chiropractic Treatment</h3>

      <p>
        The doctor of chiropractic is a specialist in spinal musculoskeletal
        disorders. We are expertly trained to diagnose and treat the many
        musculoskeletal injuries that may occur on the job, in sports, or in
        your daily life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon injury, the individual often alters the normal position or
        flexibility of the spinal vertebrae. Chiropractic treatment is designed
        to restore normal alignment and thus minimize pain and suffering. Gentle
        manipulative adjustments are often effective in rapidly returning the
        injured person to a productive status. The doctor of chiropractic can
        also provide guidance with advice designed to reduce work-related
        injuries, proper lifting procedures and therapeutic stretching
        exercises.
      </p>

            Unlike invasive weight loss surger, our procedure is applied
            externally.
          </li>
          <li>
            This revolutionary method provides results without the dangers
            associated with surgery.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlike surgical liposuction, our non-surgical lipo-sculpting allows
            you to remain active-during treatment.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Sessions with our fat loss Slim Co system are easy, painless, and
          carefree. Each session takes less than an hour. The slimming machine
          is used for a total of 15 minutes. The system is applied to the
          targeted area, which is generally the waist, hips, or thighs, for 15
          minutes. The minimum suggested treatment period is two weeks, with
          three full sessions each week. You should consult your technician
          about the maximum results for your body type, weight, and target loss.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many clients have described the session as relaxing, and even Zen.
          Some even try to catch up on phone calls with friends and loved ones
          as they lie down and the system removes excess fat. You simply lie in
          a comfortable, stationary position for twenty minutes at a time, in a
          relaxed environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the fat loss Slim Co system uses cutting edge technology, you
          fell nothing during the procedure. You may feel a bit different and
          lighter as you exit the treatment center due to the bio-stimulation
          that begins in your body to remove excess fat.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are always welcome to listen to music, or just close your eyes and
          rest during the procedure. Listening to white noise such as running
          water or ocean waves is always a relaxing way to spend the sessions.
          Ultimately, the treatment with our fat loss Slim Co system is a stark
          contrast to traditional methods of fat reduction procedures such as
          liposuction and gastric-bypass surgery. With our Slim Co weight loss
          system, you can simply lie down, relax, and let the Slim Co do all the
          work.

              Bodylight sessions have the ability to reduce body mass through
              simple, painless, and noninvasive techniques. We target the areas
              of the body that tend to be difficult to target through diet and
              exercise. With the newest advancements in technology, patients can
              find themselves on the fast track to confidence through a simple
              Bodylight session.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Bodylight emits special frequency light waves that safely
              penetrate the skin and are absorbed by the fat cells. This light
              stimulation opens the pores to the fat cells allowing water,
              glycerol and free fatty acids to move out of the fat cells and
              into the space between the cells. The fat cells then shrink while
              the excess water, glycerol and free fatty acids are safely removed
              by your body's own metabolic process.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              Though the majority of fat can be removed through diet and
              exercise, there are some areas of the body that need a little
              help. Our LED Bodylight is a non-invasive session that can be very
              effective in contouring the body by eliminating fat in those hard
              to lose areas.
            </p>

            <p>
              Patients who are concerned with their body mass index can find a
              helpful solution with our fat reduction system. Without any
              painful incisions or long term programs, the amount of
              subcutaneous fat can be easily reduced, resulting in a leaner body
              shape.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
              Results may vary from person to person due to lifestyle, body type
              and dedication to the program. No individual results should be
              seen as typical. Testimonials are stories of individual success
              and should not be taken as a guarantee.

              the Bodylight] and have noticed that my skin looks and feels more
              toned and softer than before. After just 2-3 session I noticed
              these differences and have been most pleased. The bonus is that I
              have more energy and am more conscientious of my diet and exercise
              routine. The Bodylight has been a great motivator for me."

      <h1>First Visit</h1>

      <h3>What Can I Expect During My First Visit to a Chiropractor?</h3>

      <h4>Consultation</h4>

      <p>
        On your first visit to our office you will be welcomed by our
        receptionist with a warm smile. You will then be asked to fill out our
        required forms which will help us gain some information about yourself
        and your spinal health. Save time by filling out the forms ahead of
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        After reviewing your case history, you and the doctor will discuss your
        condition to determine if chiropractic care may be of benefit to you. If
        we find that your condition would be better served by another physician,
        you will be referred to a doctor that will be able to help you the most.
        However, if our doctor feels he can help you, we will begin our
        examination with your consent. Through out this process, our focus is to
        help you achieve your optimal health potential.
      </p>

      <h4>Examination</h4>

      <p>
        After a thorough consultation with the doctor, you will undergo a
        chiropractic examination. This will include testing your reflexes and
        range of motion as well as other standard orthopedic, neurologic,
        postural, and physical examinations. From this, the doctor will gain
        valuable information regarding your condition and a better understanding
        of how chiropractic can help you. If necessary, the doctor may recommend
        X-rays or refer you for additional testing procedures.
      </p>

      <h4>X-ray</h4>

      <p>
        X-rays are sometimes required to get a full evaluation of a patient's
        condition. The need for X-ray is considered on a case by case basis.
        However, if needed, our office has an on-site, state of the art x-ray
        facility for your convenience.
      </p>

      <h4>Spinal Adjustment</h4>

      <p>
        If both you and the doctor decide that chiropractic care is appropriate,
        spinal adjustments will begin immediately. Other treatment may include
        low level laser, physical therapies , and/or soft tissue therapies. Most
        of our patients begin to see results from the very first spinal
        adjustment. Our special gentle, yet effective, alignment of the body is
        interactive with the patient; gentle enough for kids, yet able to
        restore function and movement for the athlete and senior.
      </p>

      <h4>Home Instructions</h4>

      <p>
        Prior to leaving, patients will be given instructions on certain
        activities or procedures to be conducted at home. This may include ice
        or heat application instructions, avoidance of certain activities or
        positions, as well as home exercises and/or stretches.
      </p>
